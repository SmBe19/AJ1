Food

Hermes has now xxx food.

Nar1

Hermes managed to finish yet another order.

Nar_1_1
-------
Hermes woke up with a really bad headache. It may be related to the explosion in his laboratory a few minutes ago. His latest attempt to create gold did not go as planned. After taking a close look he realized he was blind. Well, that was unfortunate.

The king won't be happy if Hermes does not manage to satisfy his requests in time. And without a happy king there will be no food for Hermes.

But Hermes is an experienced alchemist. He knows exactly what each ingredient sounds like.

He recapped the layout of his workplace. Formula on the left. Cauldron on the right. Preparation table in the middle. Single shelf with ingredients behind the table.

Hermes was a bit scared. And then the next order arrived.

Nar_1_2
-------
Hermes was happy. He managed to brew the requested formula.

Nar_1_3
-------
Hermes hoped the king's requests did not get more difficult. He liked the current level of challenge.

Nar_1_4
-------
Hermes slowly got used to not seeing anything. But he still regretted doing the experiment.

Nar_1_5
-------
Hermes should have known better. Sulfur, charcoal and saltpeter don't create gold. Not at all.

Nar_2_1
-------
Hermes was not happy at all. The king wanted a complicated formula. Hermes didn't like it one bit. Now he needed to change to his bigger laboratory where he stored the fancy stuff. In two shelves. Way too many ingredients to mix up.

Nar_2_2
-------
Hermes career in alchemy started a long time ago. Before the explosion everything seemed nice. Hermes produced whatever the king ordered. Hermes was happy as was the king.

Nar_2_3
-------
Hermes was trying to create gold. But he never managed to. And now the accident.

Nar_2_4
-------
The king always told Hermes not to waste his time on such nonsense. But Hermes did not listen. Now he wished he did.

Nar_2_5
-------
Hermes was getting quite good at this. Blindly following orders. Hopefully the king would not notice his failed attempt. The one with the explosion.

Nar_2_6
-------
Hermes hated his job. Who ordered all this crazy stuff?

Nar_3_1
-------
The next request contained some very fancy things. Hermes had to change to an even bigger laboratory. There were already three shelves. Crazy.

Nar_4_1
-------
Hermes needed to change to a bigger laboratory again. The orders were getting crazy. But Hermes was just happy to still have food on the table.

Nar_5_1
-------
The next order was for sulfur, charcoal and saltpeter. Hermes paused. Something was weird about this request. But he could not pinpoint it.
